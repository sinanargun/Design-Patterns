# Design patterns implemented in Java

* Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO desing qualities.

* Good OO desings are reusable, extensible and maintainable.

* When you see **new**, think *concrete*. Tying your code to a concrete class can make it more fragile and less flexible. The real culprit is our old friend CHANGE and how change impacts our use of new.

* Don't forget, we are also just about to remove the concrete instantiations from our client code!

## Strategy Pattern 

  > The Strategy Pattern defines family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
  and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
  clients that use it.

 ## Singleton Pattern
 
  > The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of
  access to it. The classic implementation doesn't handle multi-threading.

## Factory Pattern

  > Factories handle the details of object creation. 

  > As with every factory, the Factory Method Pattern gives us a way to encapsulate the instantiations of concrete types.
