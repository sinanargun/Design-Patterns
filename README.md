# Design patterns implemented in Java

* Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO desing qualities.

* Good OO desings are reusable, extensible and maintainable.

## Strategy Pattern 

  > The Strategy Pattern defines family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
  and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
  clients that use it.

 ## Singleton Pattern
 
  > The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of
  access to it. The classic implementation doesn't handle multi-threading.
